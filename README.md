# Simple dots application

This is a practice application that I created while I was trying to improve my skills in React.

In this application, we will have a simple functionality of adding and removing dots from our screen, along with the `undo` and `redo` functionalities.

<hr />

<b>Functionalities of the application:</b>
<ul>
    <li><i><u>Undo button</u></i>: Removes the most recently added dot from the screen
    </li>
    <li><i><u>Redo button</u></i>:
    Adds the most recently deleted dot by the Undo button
    </li>
    <li><i><u>Clear button</u></i>:
    Clears all the dots currently present on the screen
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

Open the application to see how this works!
